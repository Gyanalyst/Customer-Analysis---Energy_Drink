# Customer Analysis - Energy Drink 
Analyzed CodeX survey data, used MySQL to create a database, and produced a #PowerBI report with KPIs and client preferences. Proposed marketing strategies for enhanced brand awareness and market share.

# Problem Statement
CodeX, a German beverage company, recently launched in the Indian market across 10 cities. Their marketing team is working to scale up CodeX's share in the Indian market and has conducted surveys across these cities.
CodeX seeks insights on key clients and energy drink preferences in the Indian market for improved marketing strategies.

# Data, Requests, and Tools
The dataset and requests for this analysis were provided by CodeBasics. The following tools were used to conduct the analysis:

**MySQL:** Used to analyze the data and generate insights.

**Power BI:** Utilized to create a visual dashboard for data analysis.

**PowerPoint:** Used to create presentation slides for showcasing the analysis results.

**Adobe Photoshop:** Employed to design product images for the presentation.

# Solution
I analyzed a survey with 10,000 rows to identify the top-preferred energy drink brand, key clients, and their preferences. This assists the CodeX marketing team in developing targeted strategies to improve product, brand awareness, and market share.

# Recommendations
â€¢ The primary target audience should consist of males aged 15-45 years.

â€¢ Concentrate on major cities in tier 1 and 2, such as Bangalore, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai, Delhi, Pune, and Kolkata.

â€¢ Two distinct groups of target customers have been identified: individuals engaged in sports and exercise activities, as well as those who work or study late hours.

â€¢ Develop a refreshing energy drink that caters to the active and demanding lifestyles of the target customers.

â€¢ Implement influencer marketing on social media platforms, online ads, and TV commercials to engage the target audience effectively as these channels are most voted by customers.

â€¢ Organize sports events to create opportunities for customer engagement during physical activities.

â€¢ Collaborate with prominent sports personalities or athletes who have a strong social media presence to connect with the target audience aged 15-45.

â€¢ Ensure the energy drink is affordable within the price range of 50-99 INR.

â€¢ Prioritize eco-friendly packaging options to attract environmentally conscious consumers.

â€¢ Offer diverse flavors to cater to varying preferences and provide organic or healthy options to attract health-conscious individuals.

â€¢ Create limited edition drinks tied to trends and events to entice customers to try and collect the energy drinks.

_**By implementing these recommendations, CodeX can effectively grow its brand, improve sales, and capture a significant share of the market.**_
